I'm a doctoral researcher in computer graphics at the [Karlsruhe Institute of Technology (KIT)](//cg.ivd.kit.edu/english/), currently completing my PhD under the supervision of Prof. Carsten Dachsbacher. 
My research focuses on Monte Carlo light transport simulation for physically-based rendering, with emphasis on path guiding and volume rendering techniques.
I'm also interested in appearance modeling and filtering, as well as real-time path tracing.
Beyond research, I enjoy Lindy Hop dancing, bouldering, and occasionally obsessing a little over coffee.

As I approach the final stages of my PhD, I am seeking new opportunities to apply my expertise in computer graphics and rendering.
